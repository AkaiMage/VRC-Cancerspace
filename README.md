# Cancerspace
A screenspace shader made for VRChat with a heavy focus on configurability and specifically made for, but not limited to, use with animations.  

Please use responsibly. :^)

## Why use Cancerspace?
- It's free and open-source. It doesn't cost $40 unlike some other shaders.
- It can probably do just about any screenspace effect you want to do.
- It doesn't use keywords.

## Features
- Zoom
- Screen shake
- Falloff
- Wave distortion
- Melt distortion
- Normal-mapped distortion, with support for spritesheets
- Blur
- Image overlays, with support for spritesheets
- Cubemap overlays
- 15 image blending modes
- Screen color adjustment
- Screen movement, including rotation, scaling, and translation. All movements can be split by RGB channel.
- Stencil testing support
- Mirror-specific settings
- Platform / eye discrimination, in case you wanted that for some reason.
- Effect masking
- Can be exported automatically to a different render queue, allowing multiple Cancerspace effects to be stacked on top of each other.
- Randomizer button so music-synced animations are as easy to make as playing a rhythm game.
